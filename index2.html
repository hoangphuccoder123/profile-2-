                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm Phuc, 17-year-old and my major is Information and Technology in Vietnam. As I celebrate my journey around the sun for another year, I find joy in sharing a bit about who I am.

Professionally, I am deeply passionate about IT. Whether I'm a first year student, or a person who make projects for fun, I thrive on technology especially software. My career is not just a job to me; it's a continuous learning adventure where I embrace challenges as opportunities to grow.

As I reflect on the past year, I am grateful for the experiences, lessons, and connections that have shaped me. I look forward to the new adventures, challenges, and growth that the coming year will bring.

Let's connect, learn, and share this beautiful journey called life together!
